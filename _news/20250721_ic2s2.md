I am again in Europe for conferences: IC2S2 in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden and then ACL in Vienna, Austria. I'm co-leading a [tutorial on AI and misinformation](https://sites.google.com/view/ic2s2-misinformation-and-ai/) at IC2S2, chatting about [metaphorical dehumanization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13246) at both conferences, and presenting ongoing work on addressing antisemitism with NLP at the WOAH workshop at ACL.
