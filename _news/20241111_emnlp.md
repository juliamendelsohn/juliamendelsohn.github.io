I will be attending EMNLP in Miami to present two posters at the [Widening NLP Workshop](https://www.winlp.org/): 
* [_Framing Social Movements on Social Media: Unpacking Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Motivational Strategies_](https://journalqd.org/article/view/5896/) (Journal of Quantitative Description, 2024)
* _On the Importance of Nuanced Taxonomies for LLM-Based Understanding of Harmful Events: A Case Study on Antisemitism_ (ongoing work led by CMU PhD student Karina Halevy)
