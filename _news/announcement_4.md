I will be attending IC2S2 in Philadelphia! Patrick Wall is presenting our ongoing work: _Who Gets to Frame? Peer and Group-level Dynamics of Political Framing on Social Media_, and Josh Ashkinaze is presenting our paper _How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment_ [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13481)
