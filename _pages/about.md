***Prospective Students:*** *I am recruiting PhD students to begin in Fall 2026! Prospective PhD students should [apply](https://ischool.umd.edu/academics/phd-information-studies/admissions)Â to the [PhD program in Information Studies](https://ischool.umd.edu/academics/phd-information-studies/) at UMD, and note your interest in working with me in the statement.*

I am an incoming Assistant Professor (beginning August 2025) at the [University of Maryland College of Information](https://ischool.umd.edu/). In the meantime, I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Chicago Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/). I completed my PhD in Information at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/), and hold a BA in Linguistics and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University. 


My research lies at the intersection of language, politics, and computation. As an interdisciplinary scholar, I draw from diverse fields including natural language processing (NLP), political communication, sociolinguistics, and psychology. I am particularly interested in computationally modeling subtle rhetoric in online political discussions, and understanding the social, political and technological implications of such language. 

Here are some directions that I have worked on and continue to be excited about:

1. **Framing of complex sociopolitical issues in news and social media**, and the broader implications of these linguistic choices. I have studied framing in the context of [immigration](/assets/pdf/naacl_framing_2021.pdf) and [social movements](/assets/pdf/jqd_socialmovements_2024.pdf) on Twitter and [Russian media posts about the Russia-Ukraine war](/assets/pdf/emnlp_voynaslov_2022.pdf).
2. **Implicitly (and sometimes covertly) harmful language** in discussions about marginalized communities. I have published work about developing computational approaches to study [dehumanization](/assets/pdf/frontiers_dehumanization.pdf) and [dogwhistle communication](/assets/pdf/acl_dogwhistles_2023.pdf). Starting with my work on dogwhistles, I have recently become especially interested in building language technologies to study and combat antisemitism. 
3. **Computational sociolinguistics**. I have done some work on [language variation, change, and social meaning in online communities](/assets/pdf/scil_gendersent_2019.pdf) (and would love to do more!). I am interested in bridging sociolinguistics and computational social science to understand the relationship between [linguistic practices and social networks](/assets/pdf/icwsm_multilingual_2023.pdf)

You can find more information about me from my [curriculum vitae](/assets/pdf/CV_Aug2025.pdf).
