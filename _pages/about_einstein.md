I am an incoming Assistant Professor (beginning August 2025) at the University of Maryland, jointly appointed in the [College of Information](https://ischool.umd.edu/) and [Department of Government and Politics](https://gvpt.umd.edu/). In the meantime, I will be working as a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Chicago Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/). I am currently finishing my PhD at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/), advised by [Ceren Budak](http://cbudak.com/index.html). I completed my BA in Linguistics (2018) and MS in Computer Science (2019) at Stanford University. 


My research lies at the intersection of language, politics, and computation. I am an interdisciplinary scholar who draws from diverse fields including natural language procesing (NLP), political communication, sociolinguistics, and psychology. I am particularly interested in computationally modeling subtle and covert rhetoric in online political discussions, and understanding the social, political and technological implications of such language. Below are some directions that I have worked on and continue to be excited about:

1. Implicit hate
2. Political framing
3. Language variation and change


<!-- 

1. Computational Sociolinguistics
2. Modeling political framing and its effects
3. Implicit and covert hate
In particular, I am interested in developing computational methods to better understand (1) the framing of complex sociopolitical issues in social media, and the broader implications of these linguistic choices, (2) how people talk about other people, especially in the representations of marginalized communities, and (3) language variation and change in online communities of practice.
The primary aim of my research is to develop theories, resources, and computational methods to analyze nuanced rhetorical strategies in political discussions, and highlight the broader societal implications of these linguistic choices. By synthesizing natural language processing (NLP), sociolinguistics, political communication, and psychology, my deeply interdisciplinary research program has largely focused on modeling political framing and computationally analyzing implicitly harmful language. I am particularly interested in understanding linguistic mechanisms used to ostracize or uplift members of marginalized communities on social media, and understanding the risks of such biases for modern language technology systems. Ultimately, I endeavor to use NLP to promote social justice and make the online world a safer and more welcoming place for everybody.
These linguistic mechanisms can be particularly insidious because they can shape how audiences fundamentally understand and think about political issues. By focusing on these three strate- gies: framing, dehumanization, and dogwhistle communication, my research facilitates a deeper understanding of political language and its societal impact. -->
